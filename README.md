# Machine Learning Project README

Welcome to our machine learning project repository! This README will guide you through the project structure, installation, usage, and other important information.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model for face detection and recognition in real time .

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
- /data: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- /models: Stores trained machine learning models.
- /notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- /src: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- /docs: Documentation files, including this README.
```

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to train the model and use it for predictions:

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the dataset is stored in the `/data` directory. If necessary, preprocess the data using scripts provided in the `/src` directory.

2. **Model Training**: Execute the training script to train the machine learning model. The trained model will be saved in the `/models` directory.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Use the provided notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory to evaluate the model's performance on test data and visualize results.

4. **Deployment**: If deploying the model, utilize the deployment scripts and instructions provided in the `/src` directory.
